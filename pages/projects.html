                            Here are the projects I am the most proud of. I worked hard and learned so much from each one of these. If you would like to see
                            my featured project please head to the main page of my portfolio.

                            <p>This is an iOS application that my group and I made for our CPSC 223W Swift Programming Class. This app allows you to
                                search for recipes and then add those recipe's ingredients to a grocery list that is in the app. That grocery list can
                                then be used while you're in the store shopping. We used the Spoonacular API to obtain any recipe data. This app was made
                                alongside Storyboard and the latest version of Swift. I primarily worked on Storyboard/UI and getting data from our API
                                requests to the application's UI.</p>

                            <p>This website was the first group project for my Web Front-End Development class. This was
                                made with HTML, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and css. We used Bootstrap for styling as well. The website
                                  is meant to be a site you can make an account, take a quiz about your dog, and then you're able to
                                set up play dates for your dog. My main contribution was the css and html of all the login processes
                                and the quiz portion that is seen before proceeding to the home page. </p>

                            <p>This was the final group project for my Web Front-End Development class. This is a website that tracks the 
                                number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, etc. This is done using the <a href="https://corona.lmao.ninja/">NovelCOVID API</a>
                                which is how the tracking data is obtained. We first used <a href="https://github.com/colbyfayock/gatsby-starter-leaflet">this</a> starter
                                code to begin the website, and then added onto it. This project was written with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Gatsby. There 
                                are also  different extensions we installed via npm that are used in the project. All these can be seen in the GitHub repository readme.

                            Here are some of my other projects that show the progress that I have made throughout my coding/school career.
                            These are a mix of school projects and personal projects to show my abilities as a coder/programmer.

                                    This is a terminal based game where either the user or the computer picks a random number and the other guesses
                                    what that number is. This game was written in C++, and I am planning on rewriting this game so that it can be
                                    on a web page instead of a terminal.
