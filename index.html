										Wave Bot is a <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> bot I created for my personal Discord server.
										It's coded using Javascript, DiscordJS, NodeJS, and other various resources. I created it because I wanted to find a way to connect my 
										love for gaming and coding in a constructive and fun way. I use Discord a lot for gaming, and always had an interest in building a bot. This was a challenge 
										for me since I don't have a lot of Javascript/NodeJS experience, but I was able to complete my personal goal and finish making 
										the bot with its initial features. I am planning on adding more features in the future.

								<h2 class="major">More Information on Wave Bot</h2>

								<h3>How it's made</h3>
								<p>
									Wave Bot is made with DiscordJS, NodeJS, Javascript, FFMPEG, and other npm resources. <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">DiscordJS</a>
									is a NodeJS module that works hand-in-hand to work with the Discord API using the Javascript language.
									<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> is a framework that lets you encode, decode, filter, play, and other
									features with forms of audio and video. There were also some npm resources that were used that include
									<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv">dotenv</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core">ytdl-core</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/opusscript">opusscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon">nodemon</a>.
								</p>

								<h2>Features</h2>
								<h3>Responds to Users</h3>
								<p>
									With certain commands the bot responds in a certain way. This can be in the form of a simple text reply, a YouTube video
									, or even a photo.
								</p>

								</center>

								<h3>Sound Effects</h3>
								<p>
									If a user is in a voice channel and types in a certain command, the bot will enter the channel that user is
									in and will play a certain sound effect. The different commands determine a different sound.
								</p>

								<h3>Admin Abilities</h3>
								<p>
									This bot has certain admin commands if there is an indicated admin channel. If a user sends the bot a direct
									message, the bot sends that message to the admin channel where all admins are able to see it. Any admins can
									then respond with a command for admins only. When used the bot can directly message a user with a specific message.
									This is helpful if an admin needs to privately handle issues with users, or users are able to send
									issues on the server without making them public.
								</p>

								</center>

								<h3>Share Songs from Spotify</h3>
								<p>
									Discord gives their users the ability to link their accounts with a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> account.
									If their user is linked with their account and they have given Discord permission to share their Spotify activity on their
									account, they are able to use a certain command. This command, once typed, shares the current song they are listening to, and
									sends it to the server's music channel. This includes a link to the song.
